    "K-Means is an unsupervised ML algorithm. **Unsupervised ML** does not have \"truth labels\" for a model to learn. Rather, we use these algorithms to find what we call \"latent structure\" in our data. The most common form of \"structure\" we're looking for is groups (aka, clusters). \n",

You randomly (or, in order to make convergence quicker, cleverly) choose K centroids in the feature space, you assign each data point to the centroid/cluster closest to it, and then recalculate the centroid by taking the mean (for each predictor) of all the data points in each cluster. \n",
