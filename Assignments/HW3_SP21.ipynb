    "- **CLEARLY** mark where you are answering each question (all written questions must be answered in Markdown cells, NOT as comments in code cells)\n",

    "- a) (15 points) Using the simulated data found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmparlettpelleriti/CPSC392ParlettPelleriti/master/Data/HW3.csv), z score your variables, and use plotnine/ggplot to make a scatterplot of the data in a clear, and effective way. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- b) (30 points) In a MARKDOWN cell, discuss what patterns you see in the data, and **thouroughly discuss the pros/cons** of using *k-means*, *Gaussian Mixture Models* (with EM), *DBSCAN*, and *Hierarchical Clustering* with patterns like the ones you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Please use \"\\*\\*\" to make any mention of one of the algorithms **bold** in your discussion. For example \"I think \\*\\*DBSCAN\\*\\* is the best algorithm ever!\" will make the word \"DBSCAN\" bold in a Markdown cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "- c) (17 points) choose which algorithm you think will perform the *best* on this data, and the algorithm you think will perform the *worst* on the data. **Briefly explain why you think each algo you chose is the best/worst** (there may be overlap from part b, but please answer this separately, despite repetition).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- d) (18 points) using the TWO algorithms you chose in part c, cluster the data and calculate the silhouette scores. If you had to choose any hyperparameter values (including but not limited to: k, distance metric, linkage critera, eps, min_samples...etc), **state how you chose them**. **Which algorithm did better according to the silhouette scores and plots from part e?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- e) (20 points) using plotnine/ggplot, make one scatterplot for EACH of the two clustering algorithms that colors points by their cluster. **Are the clusters similar between the two algorithms? If yes, describe the shape/location of the clusters** (e.g. \"cluster X is a small, dense, circlular cluster with high values for x and low values for y...\"). **If no, describe the differnces in the shape/# of clusters.**"
